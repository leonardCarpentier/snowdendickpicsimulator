Set-up:

Randomly draw 25 tiles and arrange them in 5 rows of 5. This is your board.

Stack the remaining tiles.

Place the NSA marker on the left side of the board and the "YOUR VERY SPECIAL SOMEONE" marker on the top of the board. 

Place the first dick on the bottom-right tile (opposed to both NSA and YVSS).

The Game:

First player is the innocent smartphone user, second player is NSA.

Taking turns, draw two tiles, play one and discard the other one. When the stack is empty, shuffle the discarded tiles stack and use it.

A tile can be a path or a bonus.

A path can be pushed from any side of the board, pusing a row or a column and ejecting another path from the board that will be discarded too.

/!\ A tile-pushing cannot result in a dickpic being ejected from the board. 

A Bonus is either a "New Dickpic" (add a dickpic on the other tile you draw and push it on the opposite side to your marker, if not possible, just put the dickpick on the starting tile, bottom right), a switch (switch two tiles on the board without rotation, cannot switch a tile with a dick on it) or a rotation (rotate a tile on the board).

Each tile has a number on each corner: this is the movement value. After pushing a path or using a bonus, you can pick a dickpic of your choice and have it move from a maximum of X tiles, X being the movement value of the tile your used. You can only move following paths on the board tiles.

If the board end-up dickpicless after a round, put a new one on the starting, bottom-righ tile.

The goal is to have dickpics escape by your side of the board. The game ends when you have 3 dickpicks on your marker.
